/**
 * SurfaceCache is an imagelib-global service that allows caching of temporary
 * surfaces. Surfaces normally expire from the cache automatically if they go
 * too long without being accessed.
 *
 * SurfaceCache does not hold surfaces directly; instead, it holds imgFrame
 * objects, which hold surfaces but also layer on additional features specific
 * to imagelib's needs like animation, padding support, and transparent support
 * for volatile buffers.
 *
 * Sometime it's useful to temporarily prevent surfaces from expiring from the
 * cache. This is most often because losing the data could harm the user
 * experience (for example, we often don't want to allow surfaces that are
 * currently visible to expire) or because it's not possible to rematerialize
 * the surface. SurfaceCache supports this through the use of image locking; see
 * the comments for Insert() and LockImage() for more details.
 *
 * Any image which stores surfaces in the SurfaceCache *must* ensure that it
 * calls RemoveImage() before it is destroyed. See the comments for
 * RemoveImage() for more details.
