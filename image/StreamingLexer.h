/**
 * StreamingLexer is a lexing framework designed to make it simple to write
 * image decoders without worrying about the details of how the data is arriving
 * from the network.
 *
 * To use StreamingLexer:
 *
 *  - Create a State type. This should be an |enum class| listing all of the
 *    states that you can be in while lexing the image format you're trying to
 *    read.
 *
 *  - Add an instance of StreamingLexer<State> to your decoder class. Initialize
 *    it with a Transition::To() the state that you want to start lexing in.
 *
 *  - In your decoder's DoDecode() method, call Lex(), passing in the input
 *    data and length that are passed to DoDecode(). You also need to pass
 *    a lambda which dispatches to lexing code for each state based on the State
 *    value that's passed in. The lambda generally should just continue a
 *    |switch| statement that calls different methods for each State value. Each
 *    method should return a LexerTransition<State>, which the lambda should
 *    return in turn.
 *
 *  - Write the methods that actually implement lexing for your image format.
 *    These methods should return either Transition::To(), to move on to another
 *    state, or Transition::Terminate{Success,Failure}(), if lexing has
 *    terminated in either success or failure. (There are also additional
 *    transitions for unbuffered reads; see below.)
 *
 * That's all there is to it. The StreamingLexer will track your position in the
 * input and buffer enough data so that your lexing methods can process
 * everything in one pass. Lex() returns Nothing() if more data is needed, in
 * which case you should just return from DoDecode(). If lexing reaches a
 * terminal state, Lex() returns Some(State::SUCCESS) or Some(State::FAILURE),
 * and you can check which one to determine if lexing succeeded or failed and do
 * any necessary cleanup.
 *
 * There's one more wrinkle: some lexers may want to *avoid* buffering in some
 * cases, and just process the data as it comes in. This is useful if, for
 * example, you just want to skip over a large section of data; there's no point
 * in buffering data you're just going to ignore.
 *
 * You can begin an unbuffered read with Transition::ToUnbuffered(). This works
 * a little differently than Transition::To() in that you specify *two* states.
 * The @aUnbufferedState argument specifies a state that will be called
 * repeatedly with unbuffered data, as soon as it arrives. The implementation
 * for that state should return either a transition to a terminal state, or
 * Transition::ContinueUnbuffered(). Once the amount of data requested in the
 * original call to Transition::ToUnbuffered() has been delivered, Lex() will
 * transition to the @aNextState state specified via Transition::ToUnbuffered().
 * That state will be invoked with *no* data; it's just called to signal that
 * the unbuffered read is over.
 *
 * XXX(seth): We should be able to get of the |State| stuff totally once bug
 * 1198451 lands, since we can then just return a function representing the next
 * state directly.
