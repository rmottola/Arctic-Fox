# Arctic Fox web Browser

This is a rebranded Pale Moon 27.9.4. It should be built with the 10.7 SDK to function properly on 10.6.
The goal here is to implement specific security updates to keep this snow leopard supported browser as secure and up to date as possible. 

# Pale Moon web browser

This is the source code for the Pale Moon web browser, an independent
browser derived from Firefox/Mozilla community code. The source tree is
mostly laid out like Mozilla-based products.
