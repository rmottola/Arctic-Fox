  /**
   * Typically, when a player is played, it does not start immediately but is
   * added to a table of pending players on the document of its source content.
   * In the meantime it sets its hold time to the time from which playback
   * should begin.
   *
   * When the document finishes painting, any pending players in its table
   * are marked as being ready to start by calling StartOnNextTick.
   * The moment when the paint completed is also recorded, converted to a
   * timeline time, and passed to StartOnTick. This is so that when these
   * players do start, they can be timed from the point when painting
   * completed.
   *
   * After calling StartOnNextTick, players remain in the pending state until
   * the next refresh driver tick. At that time they transition out of the
   * pending state using the time passed to StartOnNextTick as the effective
   * time at which they resumed.
   *
   * This approach means that any setup time required for performing the
   * initial paint of an animation such as layerization is not deducted from
   * the running time of the animation. Without this we can easily drop the
   * first few frames of an animation, or, on slower devices, the whole
   * animation.
   *
   * Furthermore:
   *
   * - Starting the player immediately when painting finishes is problematic
   *   because the start time of the player will be ahead of its timeline
   *   (since the timeline time is based on the refresh driver time).
   *   That's a problem because the player is playing but its timing suggests
   *   it starts in the future. We could update the timeline to match the start
   *   time of the player but then we'd also have to update the timing and style
   *   of all animations connected to that timeline or else be stuck in an
   *   inconsistent state until the next refresh driver tick.
   *
   * - If we simply use the refresh driver time on its next tick, the lag
   *   between triggering an animation and its effective start is unacceptably
   *   long.
   *
   * Note that the caller of this method is responsible for removing the player
   * from any PendingPlayerTracker it may have been added to.

  // Testing only: Start a pending player using the current timeline time.
  // This is used to support existing tests that expect animations to begin

  // method, but there are a lot of them.
  //
  // As with StartOnNextTick, the caller of this method is responsible for
  // removing the player from any PendingPlayerTracker it may have been added

   * When StartOnNextTick is called, we store the ready time but we don't apply
   * it until the next tick. In the meantime, GetStartTime() will return null.
   *
   * However, if we build layer animations again before the next tick, we
   * should initialize them with the start time that GetStartTime() will return
   * on the next tick.
   *
   * If we were to simply set the start time of layer animations to null, their
   * start time would be updated to the current wallclock time when rendering
   * finishes, thus making them out of sync with the start time stored here.
   * This, in turn, will make the animation jump backwards when we build
   * animations on the next tick and apply the start time stored here.
   *
   * This method returns the start time, if resolved. Otherwise, if we have
   * a pending ready time, it returns the corresponding start time. If neither
   * of those are available, it returns null.
