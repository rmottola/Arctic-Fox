external-media-tests
===================

[Marionette Python tests][marionette-python-tests] for media playback in Mozilla Firefox. MediaTestCase uses [Firefox Puppeteer][ff-puppeteer-docs] library.

Setup
-----

Normally, you get this source by cloning a firefox repo such as mozilla-central. The path to these tests would be in <mozilla-central>/dom/media/test/external, and these instructions refer to this path as '$PROJECT_HOME'.

Running from a build
--------------------

If you have built Firefox using ./mach build from a source tree such as mozilla-central, you can run the following command:

    '''sh
    $ ./mach external-media-tests
    '''

You can pass any of the test options on this command line. They are listed below.

Running with an installer and a tests payload
---------------------------------------------

If you are testing a version of Firefox that you have not built, you must setup a virtualenv to run tests from. You will need a path to the installer or binary of Firefox.

* Create a virtualenv called `foo`.

   ```sh
   $ virtualenv foo
   $ source foo/bin/activate #or `foo\Scripts\activate` on Windows
   ```

* Install `external-media-tests` in development mode. (To get an environment that is closer to what is actually used in Mozilla's automation jobs, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` first.)

   ```sh
   $ python setup.py develop
   ```

Now `external-media-tests` should be a recognized command. Try `external-media-tests --help` to see if it works.


Running the Tests
-----------------

In the examples below, `$FF_PATH` is a path to a recent Firefox binary. If you are running from a source build, the commands below should be invoked with:

    '''sh
    ./mach external-media-tests
    '''

If you are running with a virtualenv, you will need to run like this:

    '''sh
    external-media-tests --binary $FF_PATH
    '''

or

    '''sh
    external-media-tests --installer $FF_INSTALLER_PATH
    '''

or

    '''sh
    external-media-tests --installer-url <url to installer package>
    '''

The following examples assume that you will use of these command lines instead of $EXTERNAL-MEDIA-TESTS.


This runs all the tests listed in `$PROJECT_HOME/external_media_tests/manifest.ini`:

   ```sh
   $ $EXTERNAL-MEDIA-TESTS
   ```

You can also run all the tests at a particular path:

   ```sh
   $ $EXTERNAL-MEDIA-TESTS some/path/foo
   ```

Or you can run the tests that are listed in a manifest file of your choice.

   ```sh
   $ $EXTERNAL-MEDIA-TESTS some/other/path/manifest.ini
   ```

By default, the urls listed in `external_media_tests/urls/default.ini` are used for the tests, but you can also supply your own ini file of urls:

   ```sh
   $ $EXTERNAL-MEDIA-TESTS --urls some/other/path/my_urls.ini
   ```

### Running EME tests

In order to run EME tests, you must use a Firefox profile that has a signed plugin-container.exe and voucher.bin. With Netflix, this will be created when you log in and save the credentials. You must also use a custom .ini file for urls to the provider's content and indicate which test to run, like above. Ex:

   ```sh
   $ $EXTERNAL-MEDIA-TESTS some/path/tests.ini --profile custom_profile --urls some/path/provider-urls.ini
   ```


### Running tests in a way that provides information about a crash

What if Firefox crashes during a test run? You want to know why! To report useful crash data, the test runner needs access to a "minidump_stackwalk" binary and a "symbols.zip" file.

1. Download a `minidump_stackwalk` binary for your platform (save it wherever). Get it from http://hg.mozilla.org/build/tools/file/tip/breakpad/.
2. Make `minidump_stackwalk` executable

   ```sh
   $ chmod +x path/to/minidump_stackwalk
   ```

3. Create an environment variable called `MINIDUMP_STACKWALK` that points to that local path

   ```sh
   $ export MINIDUMP_STACKWALK=path/to/minidump_stackwalk
   ```

4. Download the `crashreporter-symbols.zip` file for the Firefox build you are testing and extract it. Example: ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/tinderbox-builds/mozilla-aurora-win32/1427442016/firefox-38.0a2.en-US.win32.crashreporter-symbols.zip

5. Run the tests with a `--symbols-path` flag

  ```sh
   $ $EXTERNAL-MEDIA-TESTS --symbols-path path/to/example/firefox-38.0a2.en-US.win32.crashreporter-symbols
  ```

To check whether the above setup is working for you, trigger a (silly) Firefox crash while the tests are running. One way to do this is with the [crashme add-on](https://github.com/luser/crashme) -- you can add it to Firefox even while the tests are running. Another way on Linux and Mac OS systems:

1. Find the process id (PID) of the Firefox process being used by the tests.

  ```sh
   $ ps x | grep 'Firefox'
  ```

2. Kill the Firefox process with SIGABRT.
  ```sh
  # 1234 is an example of a PID
   $ kill -6 1234
  ```

Somewhere in the output produced by `external-media-tests`, you should see something like:

```
0:12.68 CRASH: MainThread pid:1234. Test:test_basic_playback.py TestVideoPlayback.test_playback_starts.

### Setting up for network shaping tests (browsermobproxy)

1. Download the browsermob proxy zip file from http://bmp.lightbody.net/. The most current version as of this writing is browsermob-proxy-2.1.0-beta-2-bin.zip.
2. Unpack the .zip file.
3. Verify that you can launch browsermobproxy on your machine by running \<browsermob\>/bin/browsermob-proxy (or browsermob-proxy.bat on Windows) on your machine. I had to do a lot of work to install and use a java that browsermobproxy would like.
4. Import the certificate into your Firefox profile. Select Preferences->Advanced->Certificates->View Certificates->Import... Navigate to <browsermob>/ssl-support and select cybervilliansCA.cer. Select all of the checkboxes.
5. Tell marionette where browsermobproxy is and what port to start it on. Add the following command-line parameters to your external-media-tests command line:

<pre><code>
--browsermob-script <browsermob>/bin/browsermob-proxy --browsermob-port 999 --profile <your saved profile>
</code></pre>

You can then call browsermob to shape the network. You can find an example in external_media_tests/playback/test_playback_limiting_bandwidth.py. Another example can be found at https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/testing/marionette/harness/marionette/tests/unit/test_browsermobproxy.py.

### A warning about video URLs
The ini files in `external_media_tests/urls` may contain URLs pulled from Firefox crash or bug data. Automated tests don't care about video content, but you might: visit these at your own risk and be aware that they may be NSFW. We do not intend to ever moderate or filter these URLs.

Writing a test
--------------
Write your test in a new or existing `test_*.py` file under `$PROJECT_HOME/external_media_tests`. Add it to the appropriate `manifest.ini` file(s) as well. Look in `media_utils` for useful video-playback functions.
