/// between async messages and actor destruction. The priniple is that the
/// child side is always the one that tells the parent that the actor pair is
/// going to be destroyed through the async Destroy message, and the parent
/// side always sends the __delete__ message.
/// Once ChildActor::Destroy has been called it is invalid to send any other
/// IPDL message from the child, although the child might receive messages
/// from the parent that were sent before the parent received the Destroy
/// message. Always check the result of ChildActor::Destroy before sending
/// anything.
///
/// The actual IPDL protocol must have the following messages:
///
/// child:
///   async __delete__();
/// parent:
///   async Destroy();
///   sync DestroySynchronously();
